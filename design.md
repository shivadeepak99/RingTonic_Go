# Project: RingTonic - Instant Ringtone Generation from Social Media

**Document Version:** 1.0 **Date:** August 11, 2025 **Status:** Confidential | For Investor & Internal
Review Only

# 1. Executive Summary

**RingTonic** is a mobile and web application that eliminates the friction between discovering
audio content on social media and using it for personal device customization. In a market where
billions of users engage with short-form video on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram,
a common desire is to capture a trending sound, a memorable movie quote, or a custom song
edit and set it as a ringtone. The current process is cumbersome, multi-stepped, and technically
prohibitive for the average user.
RingTonic solves this with a seamless, one-click solution. Users simply paste a video link into
our app, and our automated backend extracts the audio, allows for optional trimming, and sets it
as the device's ringtone instantly. This transforms a 10-minute, multi-app manual process into a
10-second automated action.
Our initial target market is Android users, who represent over 70% of the global mobile OS
market and have open access to system settings for ringtone customization. The MVP is
designed for rapid development and deployment, leveraging a robust and scalable tech stack.
We project strong user adoption driven by viral trends on social media, with a clear path to
monetization through premium features.

# 2. Problem Statement

The discovery of new, personalized audio happens primarily on social video platforms. However,
the journey from discovery to utility (i.e., setting a ringtone) is fraught with friction.
● **High Technical Barrier:** The current process requires users to find and use multiple,
often-untrusted, third-party tools: a web-based video downloader, an audio converter, a
file manager, and finally, navigating complex system settings.
● **Time-Consuming & Inefficient:** The manual workflow can take anywhere from 5 to 15
minutes and involves downloading large video files, managing local storage, and manual
conversion. This friction leads to a high user drop-off rate.
● **Poor User Experience:** Existing solutions are often ad-riddled, pose security risks
(malware from downloader sites), and fail to provide a cohesive, mobile-first experience.
There is no integrated tool that handles the process from end to end.


```
● Missed Opportunity: Content creators and users share captivating audio clips daily, but
the potential for these sounds to become a part of a user's daily life (as a ringtone or
notification sound) is lost due to the difficulty of the process.
```
# 3. Solution Overview

RingTonic provides a centralized, automated, and elegant solution that directly addresses the
stated problems. Our core value proposition is **"From Link to Ringtone in One Click."**
● **Automation:** Our backend, orchestrated by n8n, fully automates the workflow. Once a
user pastes a link, the processes of downloading, audio extraction, conversion, and
delivery are handled without any further user intervention.
● **Simplicity:** The user interface is minimalist. The primary action is pasting a link and
clicking a button. An optional, intuitive trimming tool allows for easy customization before
finalizing the ringtone.
● **Integration:** For Android users, the app leverages the native RingtoneManager API to
set the audio file as the default ringtone or notification sound directly from the app,
providing a true one-click experience.
● **Speed & Efficiency:** By processing everything on the backend, we avoid burdening the
user's device with heavy downloads or processing tasks. The final output is a small,
optimized audio file (e.g., .mp3 or .m4a), delivered directly to the app.

# 4. Feature Breakdown

**MVP Features (Version 1.0)**

1. **Link Ingestion:** A single input field on the web and mobile app to accept public links
    from YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.
2. **Automated Audio Extraction:** Backend workflow triggers yt-dlp to fetch the highest
    quality audio stream from the provided link.
3. **Audio Conversion:** Use FFmpeg to convert the extracted audio into a standard ringtone
    format (.mp3).
4. **Audio Trimmer & Preview:** A simple visual interface to select a segment of the audio
    (e.g., up to 30 seconds). Users can play the trimmed selection before finalizing.
5. **One-Click "Set as Ringtone" (Android):** Deep integration with the Android OS to set
    the generated audio as the ringtone, notification, or alarm sound.
6. **Ringtone History:** A locally stored list (SQLite) within the app of previously created
    ringtones for easy access and management.

    drive initial traffic and demonstrate capability.
**Nice-to-Have Features (Version 2.0)**


1. **iOS Support:** A companion app for iOS that saves the ringtone to the Files app with
    clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set it via GarageBand (the standard iOS
    method).
2. **Cloud Sync:** User accounts to sync ringtone history across web and mobile devices.
3. **Advanced Audio Editing:** Features like Fade In/Fade Out, volume normalization.
4. **Social Sharing:** Allow users to share a link to the RingTonic page with their created
    ringtone, driving viral growth.
5. **Search Functionality:** Instead of pasting a link, users can search for videos directly
    within the app.
**Monetization Strategy**
A freemium model is proposed:
● **Free Tier:** Ad-supported. Allows creation of up to 5 ringtones per month. Standard audio
quality.
● **Pro Tier ($1.99/month or $9.99/year):**
○ Ad-free experience.
○ Unlimited ringtone creations.
○ Higher audio quality options (e.g., 320kbps).
○ Cloud backup and sync of ringtone library.
○ Access to advanced editing features.

# 5. User Flow

1. **Discovery:** User sees/hears a sound they like in a YouTube video, Instagram Reel, or
    TikTok clip.
2. **Action:** User copies the video's share link.
3. **Engagement:** User opens the RingTonic app (or website).
4. **Input:** User pastes the link into the input field and clicks "Create."
5. **Processing (Automated):**
    ○ The app sends the link to our backend.
    ○ The backend validates the link and initiates an n8n workflow.
    ○ The workflow downloads the audio, converts it, and sends a notification of
       completion back to the app.
6. **Customization (Optional):** The app presents the extracted audio in a simple trimmer
    UI. The user can adjust the start/end points and preview the result.
7. **Confirmation:** User clicks "Set as Ringtone."
8. **Completion:**
    ○ **(Android):** The app uses the RingtoneManager API to set the new audio file
       as the device's ringtone. A confirmation message ("Ringtone Set!") is displayed.
    ○ **(Web/iOS future state):** The app provides the .mp3 file for download with
       instructions.


9. **History:** The newly created ringtone is added to the user's local history list for future
    use.

# 6. System Architecture

The system is designed as a decoupled microservices-style architecture, enabling scalability
and maintainability.
**High-Level Diagram:
Workflow Explanation:**

1. **Frontend (Next.js/Flutter):** The user interacts with the UI, pasting a link. The frontend
    sends this link via a REST API call to the Go Backend.
2. **Backend API (Go):** This is a lightweight API server. Its primary job is to receive the
    request, validate it, and trigger the automation workflow by calling a specific n8n
    webhook URL. It does not perform the heavy lifting itself, ensuring it remains responsive.
    It also serves endpoints for the mobile app to check job status and fetch the final file.
3. **Automation Engine (n8n):** This is the core of the operation.
    ○ It receives the webhook from the Go backend.


```
○ Node 1: yt-dlp Execution: It runs a shell command to execute yt-dlp with
parameters to download only the audio (-x) in the best possible quality (-f
'ba') and save it to a temporary location on the local filesystem.
○ Node 2: FFmpeg Execution: It runs another shell command to execute FFmpeg,
pointing to the downloaded audio file. It converts the file to .mp3 format, ready
for use as a ringtone.
○ Node 3: File Storage: The processed .mp3 is moved to a permanent storage
location.
○ Node 4: Callback: It sends a webhook/API call back to the Go backend to
update the job status to "Completed" and provides the URL/path to the final file.
```
4. **Storage (Local Filesystem -> S3):** For the MVP, all audio files (temporary and final) are
    stored on the server's local filesystem. This will be migrated to an S3-compatible object
    storage service (like MinIO or DigitalOcean Spaces) for scalability.
5. **Database (SQLite):** The mobile app uses a local SQLite database to store the history of
    created ringtones, including metadata like the original video title and a pointer to the
    locally saved audio file.

# 7. Tech Stack Justification

```
● Automation (n8n): Chosen for its visual workflow builder, which dramatically speeds up
development and iteration of the core business logic. It allows us to connect different
services (yt-dlp, FFmpeg, our API) without writing extensive glue code.
● Backend (Go): Selected for its high performance, excellent concurrency model
(goroutines), and low memory footprint. This is crucial for handling many simultaneous
download/conversion jobs efficiently on a cost-effective VPS. The net/http package
provides a robust foundation for building a simple, fast API.
● Video/Audio Processing (yt-dlp + FFmpeg): These are the undisputed industry
standards. yt-dlp is a actively maintained fork of youtube-dl with support for a vast
number of websites. FFmpeg is a powerful, universal tool for audio/video manipulation.
Using them as CLI tools via n8n is simple and reliable.
● Frontend (Next.js): Provides a fast, modern web experience with Server-Side
Rendering (SSR) for good SEO and a great developer experience with React. It's perfect
for building the simple landing page and web app.
● Mobile App (Flutter): Allows for cross-platform development from a single codebase,
significantly reducing development time and cost for future expansion to iOS. Its direct
access to native device APIs (like Android's RingtoneManager) is critical for the core
feature.
● Database (SQLite): Perfect for the MVP's on-device storage needs. It's lightweight,
serverless, and integrated into mobile platforms. It requires zero configuration and is
sufficient for storing user history locally.
```

```
● Storage (Local Filesystem): The simplest and fastest solution for an MVP running on a
single VPS. The architecture is designed to make swapping this out for S
straightforward.
```
# 8. Feasibility Analysis

```
● Technical Feasibility (High): All core technologies are mature, well-documented, and
proven. The APIs required for the Android integration are standard parts of the OS. The
main technical task is the integration and orchestration, which n8n is designed to
simplify. The concept is a novel application of existing tools, not the invention of new
ones.
● Operational Feasibility (Medium): The primary operational task is maintaining the
backend server. This includes ensuring yt-dlp stays updated to handle changes in
target platforms (YouTube, etc.). The process can be automated. Server costs will be the
main operational expense, but a Go-based stack on a VPS is highly cost-effective.
● Legal Feasibility (Low-Medium): This is the most significant challenge. See Risks
section. The service itself doesn't host copyrighted content persistently in a public library.
It acts as a "personal-use format-shifting" tool, which occupies a legal gray area in many
jurisdictions. The legal standing depends heavily on the country of operation.
```
# 9. Challenges & Risks

1. **Copyright & DMCA (High Risk):**
    ○ **Risk:** The service facilitates the downloading of copyrighted audio. We will likely
       receive DMCA takedown notices from rights holders if hosted in the US or other
       stringent jurisdictions.
    ○ **Mitigation:** See Section 10.
2. **Platform Blocking (Medium Risk):**
    ○ **Risk:** YouTube, Meta (Instagram), and TikTok may actively block server IPs
       associated with our service to prevent downloading.
    ○ **Mitigation:** Implement a proxy pool or use residential proxies to rotate IP
       addresses. Rate-limit requests to mimic human behavior.
3. **Scalability of Storage & Processing (Medium Risk):**
    ○ **Risk:** The local filesystem of a single VPS will fill up quickly with heavy use. CPU
       load from many concurrent FFmpeg jobs could degrade performance.
    ○ **Mitigation:** See Section 11.
4. **yt-dlp Breakage (Low Risk):**
    ○ **Risk:** Target sites change their structure, temporarily breaking yt-dlp.
    ○ **Mitigation:** yt-dlp is updated very frequently. Implement a monitoring system
       to detect failures and a semi-automated process to update the yt-dlp binary on
       the server.


# 10. Proposed Solutions to Risks

```
● DMCA Mitigation Strategy:
```
1. **Jurisdiction Selection:** Host the backend server (the VPS running Go, n8n, and
    storage) in a **DMCA-resistant country**. Top candidates include **Switzerland, the**
    **Netherlands, and Iceland** , which have different legal frameworks regarding
    copyright and personal use. All legal counsel should be sought to confirm the
    best choice.
2. **Terms of Service:** Implement a clear ToS that places the responsibility on the
    user, stating they must have the rights to the content they are processing for
    personal use.
3. **Ephemeral Storage Policy:** Implement a strict data retention policy. Generated
    ringtones are user-specific and should be deleted from server storage after a
    short period (e.g., 24-72 hours) after being delivered to the user. The service acts
    as a transient processor, not a permanent library.

# 11. Scalability Plan

The MVP architecture is designed to scale gracefully with the following phased upgrades:
● **Phase 1 (Post-MVP, 10k users):**
○ **Storage:** Migrate from local filesystem to an **S3-compatible object storage**
service (e.g., MinIO self-hosted, or DigitalOcean Spaces/Wasabi). This
decouples storage from compute.
○ **Database:** For cloud sync features, introduce a managed **PostgreSQL** database
(e.g., RDS) to replace SQLite for user account data.
● **Phase 2 (Growth, 100k+ users):**
○ **Compute:** Decouple the n8n worker from the API server. Use a dedicated, more
powerful instance for n8n.
○ **Load Balancing:** Introduce a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) to distribute
traffic between multiple instances of the Go API server.
○ **Containerization:** Containerize the entire stack (Go, n8n) using **Docker** and
manage deployments with **Kubernetes** for auto-scaling and high availability.
● **Phase 3 (Global Scale, 1M+ users):**
○ **Job Queue:** Replace the direct n8n webhook with a robust message queue (e.g.,
**RabbitMQ, NATS** ). The Go API will publish jobs to the queue, and a fleet of n8n
workers will consume these jobs, allowing for massive horizontal scaling of the
processing layer.
○ **CDN:** Use a Content Delivery Network (e.g., Cloudflare, Fastly) to serve the final
ringtone files to users, reducing latency and backend load.

# 12. Deployment Plan


**Localhost Development Environment:**
A docker-compose.yml file will be created to orchestrate the entire stack locally for
development.
● go-service: Runs the Go backend with hot-reloading.
● n8n-service: Runs the n8n instance. Developers can access the UI at
localhost:5678 to build/edit workflows.
● nextjs-service: Runs the Next.js frontend dev server. This setup ensures a
consistent development environment that mirrors production.
**MVP Deployment to a VPS:**

1. **Provision VPS:** Select a VPS provider in the chosen DMCA-resistant jurisdiction (e.g., a
    provider in Switzerland).
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
    ○ On git push to the main branch:
    ○ The action builds Docker images for the Go backend and the Next.js app.
    ○ Pushes the images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GHCR).
    ○ SSH into the VPS.
    ○ Pulls the latest images.
    ○ Restarts the services using docker-compose up -d.
4. **Nginx Configuration:** Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the
    appropriate services (e.g., api.ringtonic.com to the Go service,
    app.ringtonic.com to the Next.js service). Nginx will also handle SSL termination
    (Let's Encrypt).
5. **n8n Setup:** The n8n workflow will be configured once on the production instance and
    exported as a JSON file, which can be version-controlled in Git.
